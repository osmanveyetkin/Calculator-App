# Calculator-App
Calculator-App with CS Windows Form , used clean code and OOP rules

**CalculatorApp** is a simple calculator application developed using C# and Windows Forms. This project demonstrates how to perform basic arithmetic operations while reducing code redundancy by using the Tag property and single event handlers for buttons.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), modulus (`%`), and exponentiation (`^`).
- **Decimal Support:** Proper handling of decimal numbers to ensure correct calculations.
- **Positive/Negative Toggle:** Ability to switch the sign of the entered number.
- **Reset Functionality:** Clears the calculator and resets the state.
- **Single Event Handling:** Utilizes the Tag property so that all number and operator buttons are managed by a single event handler respectively.

## Technologies
- **C#**
- **Windows Forms**
- **.NET Framework** (or .NET Core/5/6, depending on your setup)
